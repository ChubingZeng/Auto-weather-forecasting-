# Auto-weather-forecasting-
This Python program scraps weather forecasting data from DarkSky, and tells you the humidity, maximum temperature and minimum temperature for the next week. 

If you are using a MAC, this program also read out the highest and lowest temperature for the next week. 

The default location is my home (somewhere is Pasadena), you can also use it for your location by changing lat and long.
